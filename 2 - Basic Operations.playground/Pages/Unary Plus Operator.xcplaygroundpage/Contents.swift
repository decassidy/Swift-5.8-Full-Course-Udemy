 ## Unary Plus Operator

 The *unary plus operator* `(+)` simply returns the value it operates on, without any change:
*/
let minusSix = -6
let alsoMinusSix = +minusSix  // alsoMinusSix equals -6
/*:
 Although the unary plus operator doesnâ€™t actually do anything, you can use it to provide symmetry in your code for positive numbers when also using the unary minus operator for negative numbers.
