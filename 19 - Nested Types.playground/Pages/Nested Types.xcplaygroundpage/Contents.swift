 # Nested Types
 
 ### Define types inside the scope of another type.
 
 Enumerations are often created to support a specific class or structureâ€™s functionality. Similarly, it can be convenient to define utility classes and structures purely for use within the context of a more complex type. To accomplish this, Swift enables you to define nested types, whereby you nest supporting enumerations, classes, and structures within the definition of the type they support.

 To nest a type within another type, write its definition within the outer braces of the type it supports. Types can be nested to as many levels as are required.
