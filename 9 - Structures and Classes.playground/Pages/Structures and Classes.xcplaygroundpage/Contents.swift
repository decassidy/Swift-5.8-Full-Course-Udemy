 # Structures and Classes
 ### Model custom types that encapsulate data.
 
 *Structures* and *classes* are general-purpose, flexible constructs that become the building blocks of your program’s code. You define properties and methods to add functionality to your structures and classes using the same syntax you use to define constants, variables, and functions.

 Unlike other programming languages, Swift doesn’t require you to create separate interface and implementation files for custom structures and classes. In Swift, you define a structure or class in a single file, and the external interface to that class or structure is automatically made available for other code to use.

/*:
 - Note: An instance of a class is traditionally known as an *object*. However, Swift structures and classes are much closer in functionality than in other languages, and much of this chapter describes functionality that applies to instances of *either* a class or a structure type. Because of this, the more general term *instance* is used.
