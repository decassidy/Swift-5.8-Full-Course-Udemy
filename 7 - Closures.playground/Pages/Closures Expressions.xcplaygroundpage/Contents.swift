 ## Closure Expressions

 Nested functions, as introduced in [Nested Functions](https://docs.swift.org/swift-book/documentation/the-swift-programming-language/functions/#Nested-Functions)\, are a convenient means of naming and defining self-contained blocks of code as part of a larger function. However, itâ€™s sometimes useful to write shorter versions of function-like constructs without a full declaration and name. This is particularly true when you work with functions or methods that take functions as one or more of their arguments.

 *Closure expressions* are a way to write inline closures in a brief, focused syntax. Closure expressions provide several syntax optimizations for writing closures in a shortened form without loss of clarity or intent. The closure expression examples below illustrate these optimizations by refining a single example of the `sorted(by:)` method over several iterations, each of which expresses the same functionality in a more succinct way.
