 ## Propagating Errors Using Throwing Functions
 
 To indicate that a function, method, or initializer can throw an error, you write the `throws` keyword in the function’s declaration after its parameters. A function marked with `throws` is called a *throwing function*. If the function specifies a return type, you write the throws keyword before the return arrow (`->`).
*/
/*:
 ````
 func canThrowErrors() throws -> String

 func cannotThrowErrors() -> String
 ````
*/
/*:
 A throwing function propagates errors that are thrown inside of it to the scope from which it’s called.
*/
/*:
 - Note:Only throwing functions can propagate errors. Any errors thrown inside a nonthrowing function must be handled inside the function.
*/
/*:
 In the example below, the VendingMachine class has a vend(itemNamed:) method that throws an appropriate VendingMachineError if the requested item isn’t available, is out of stock, or has a cost that exceeds the current deposited amount:
*/
 struct Item {
     var price: Int
     var count: Int
 }

 class VendingMachine {
     var inventory = [
         "Candy Bar": Item(price: 12, count: 7),
         "Chips": Item(price: 10, count: 4),
         "Pretzels": Item(price: 7, count: 11)
     ]
     var coinsDeposited = 0

     func vend(itemNamed name: String) throws {
         guard let item = inventory[name] else {
             throw VendingMachineError.invalidSelection
         }

         guard item.count > 0 else {
             throw VendingMachineError.outOfStock
         }

         guard item.price <= coinsDeposited else {
             throw VendingMachineError.insufficientFunds(coinsNeeded: item.price - coinsDeposited)
         }

         coinsDeposited -= item.price

         var newItem = item
         newItem.count -= 1
         inventory[name] = newItem

         print("Dispensing \(name)")
     }
 }
/*:
 The implementation of the vend(itemNamed:) method uses guard statements to exit the method early and throw appropriate errors if any of the requirements for purchasing a snack aren’t met. Because a throw statement immediately transfers program control, an item will be vended only if all of these requirements are met.

 Because the vend(itemNamed:) method propagates any errors it throws, any code that calls this method must either handle the errors — using a do-catch statement, try?, or try!— or continue to propagate them. For example, the buyFavoriteSnack(person:vendingMachine:) in the example below is also a throwing function, and any errors that the vend(itemNamed:) method throws will propagate up to the point where the buyFavoriteSnack(person:vendingMachine:) function is called.
*/
 let favoriteSnacks = [
     "Alice": "Chips",
     "Bob": "Licorice",
     "Eve": "Pretzels",
 ]
 func buyFavoriteSnack(person: String, vendingMachine: VendingMachine) throws {
     let snackName = favoriteSnacks[person] ?? "Candy Bar"
     try vendingMachine.vend(itemNamed: snackName)
 }
/*:
 In this example, the buyFavoriteSnack(person: vendingMachine:) function looks up a given person’s favorite snack and tries to buy it for them by calling the vend(itemNamed:) method. Because the vend(itemNamed:) method can throw an error, it’s called with the try keyword in front of it.

 Throwing initializers can propagate errors in the same way as throwing functions. For example, the initializer for the PurchasedSnack structure in the listing below calls a throwing function as part of the initialization process, and it handles any errors that it encounters by propagating them to its caller.
*/
 struct PurchasedSnack {
     let name: String
     init(name: String, vendingMachine: VendingMachine) throws {
         try vendingMachine.vend(itemNamed: name)
         self.name = name
     }
 }
