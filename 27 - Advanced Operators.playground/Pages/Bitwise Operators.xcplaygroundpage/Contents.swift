 ## Bitwise Operators
 
 Bitwise operators enable you to manipulate the individual raw data bits within a data structure. Theyâ€™re often used in low-level programming, such as graphics programming and device driver creation. Bitwise operators can also be useful when you work with raw data from external sources, such as encoding and decoding data for communication over a custom protocol.

 Swift supports all of the bitwise operators found in C, as described below.
