 ## Stored Properties and Instance Variables

 If you have experience with Objective-C, you may know that it provides two ways to store values and references as part of a class instance. In addition to properties, you can use instance variables as a backing store for the values stored in a property.

 Swift unifies these concepts into a single property declaration. A Swift property doesn’t have a corresponding instance variable, and the backing store for a property isn’t accessed directly. This approach avoids confusion about how the value is accessed in different contexts and simplifies the property’s declaration into a single, definitive statement. All information about the property — including its name, type, and memory management characteristics — is defined in a single location as part of the type’s definition.
