 ## Shorthand Getter Declaration

 If the entire body of a getter is a single expression, the getter implicitly returns that expression. Hereâ€™s an another version of the `Rect` structure that takes advantage of this shorthand notation and the shorthand notation for setters:

            origin.x = newValue.x - (size.width / 2)
            origin.y = newValue.y - (size.height / 2)

 Omitting the return from a getter follows the same rules as omitting return from a function, as described in [Functions With an Implicit Return](https://docs.swift.org/swift-book/documentation/the-swift-programming-language/functions/#Functions-With-an-Implicit-Return)\.
