 ## String Literals

 You can include predefined `String` values within your code as *string literals*. A string literal is a sequence of characters surrounded by double quotation marks `(")`.

 Use a string literal as an initial value for a constant or variable:
*/
let someString = "Some string literal value"
/*:
 Note that Swift infers a type of String for the someString constant because itâ€™s initialized with a string literal value.
