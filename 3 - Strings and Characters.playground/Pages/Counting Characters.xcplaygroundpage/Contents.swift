 ## Counting Characters

 To retrieve a count of the `Character` values in a string, use the count property of the string:
*/
let unusualMenagerie = "Koala 🐨, Snail 🐌, Penguin 🐧, Dromedary 🐪"
print("unusualMenagerie has \(unusualMenagerie.count) characters")
// Prints "unusualMenagerie has 40 characters"
/*:
 Note that Swift’s use of extended grapheme clusters for `Character` values means that string concatenation and modification may not always affect a string’s character count.

 For example, if you initialize a new string with the four-character word cafe, and then append a COMBINING ACUTE ACCENT `(U+0301)` to the end of the string, the resulting string will still have a character count of `4`, with a fourth character of `é`, not `e`:
*/
var word = "cafe"
print("the number of characters in \(word) is \(word.count)")
// Prints "the number of characters in cafe is 4"


word += "\u{301}"    // COMBINING ACUTE ACCENT, U+0301


print("the number of characters in \(word) is \(word.count)")
// Prints "the number of characters in café is 4"
/*:
 - Note: Extended grapheme clusters can be composed of multiple Unicode scalars. This means that different characters— and different representations of the same character— can require different amounts of memory to store. Because of this, characters in Swift don’t each take up the same amount of memory within a string’s representation. As a result, the number of characters in a string can’t be calculated without iterating through the string to determine its extended grapheme cluster boundaries. If you are working with particularly long string values, be aware that the count property must iterate over the Unicode scalars in the entire string in order to determine the characters for that string.

    The count of the characters returned by the `count` property isn’t always the same as the `length` property of an `NSString` that contains the same characters. The length of an `NSString` is based on the number of 16-bit code units within the string’s UTF-16 representation and not the number of Unicode extended grapheme clusters within the string.
