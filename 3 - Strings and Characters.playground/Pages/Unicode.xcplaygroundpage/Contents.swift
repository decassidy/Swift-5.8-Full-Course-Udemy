 ## Unicode

 Unicode is an international standard for encoding, representing, and processing text in different writing systems. It enables you to represent almost any character from any language in a standardized form, and to read and write those characters to and from an external source such as a text file or web page. Swiftâ€™s `String` and `Character` types are fully Unicode-compliant, as described in this section.
