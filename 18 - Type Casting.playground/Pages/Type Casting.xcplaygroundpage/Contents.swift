 # Type Casting
 
 ### Determine a valueâ€™s runtime type and give it more specific type information.
 
 *Type casting* is a way to check the type of an instance, or to treat that instance as a different superclass or subclass from somewhere else in its own class hierarchy.

 Type casting in Swift is implemented with the is and as operators. These two operators provide a simple and expressive way to check the type of a value or cast a value to a different type.

 You can also use type casting to check whether a type conforms to a protocol, as described in [Checking for Protocol Conformance](https://docs.swift.org/swift-book/documentation/the-swift-programming-language/protocols/#Checking-for-Protocol-Conformance).
