 ## Access Levels for Single-Target Apps
 
 When you write a simple single-target app, the code in your app is typically self-contained within the app and doesn’t need to be made available outside of the app’s module. The default access level of internal already matches this requirement. Therefore, you don’t need to specify a custom access level. You may, however, want to mark some parts of your code as file private or private in order to hide their implementation details from other code within the app’s module.
