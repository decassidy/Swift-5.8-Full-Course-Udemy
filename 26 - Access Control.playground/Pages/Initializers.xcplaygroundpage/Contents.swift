 ## Initializers
 
 Custom initializers can be assigned an access level less than or equal to the type that they initialize. The only exception is for required initializers (as defined in [Required Initializers](https://docs.swift.org/swift-book/documentation/the-swift-programming-language/initialization/#Required-Initializers))\. A required initializer must have the same access level as the class it belongs to.

 As with function and method parameters, the types of an initializer’s parameters can’t be more private than the initializer’s own access level.
