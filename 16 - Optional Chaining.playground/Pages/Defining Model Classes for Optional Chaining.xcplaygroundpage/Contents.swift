 ## Defining Model Classes for Optional Chaining
 
 You can use optional chaining with calls to properties, methods, and subscripts that are more than one level deep. This enables you to drill down into subproperties within complex models of interrelated types, and to check whether it’s possible to access properties, methods, and subscripts on those subproperties.

 The code snippets below define four model classes for use in several subsequent examples, including examples of multilevel optional chaining. These classes expand upon the `Person` and `Residence` model from above by adding a `Room` and `Address` class, with associated properties, methods, and subscripts.

 The `Person` class is defined in the same way as before:
*/
 class Person {
     var residence: Residence?
 }
/*:
 The `Residence` class is more complex than before. This time, the `Residence` class defines a variable property called `rooms`, which is initialized with an empty array of type `[Room]`:
*/
 class Residence {
     var rooms: [Room] = []
     var numberOfRooms: Int {
         return rooms.count
     }
     subscript(i: Int) -> Room {
         get {
             return rooms[i]
         }
         set {
             rooms[i] = newValue
         }
     }
     func printNumberOfRooms() {
         print("The number of rooms is \(numberOfRooms)")
     }
     var address: Address?
 }
/*:
 Because this version of `Residence` stores an array of `Room` instances, its `numberOfRooms` property is implemented as a computed property, not a stored property. The computed `numberOfRooms` property simply returns the value of the `count` property from the rooms array.

 As a shortcut to accessing its `rooms` array, this version of `Residence` provides a read-write subscript that provides access to the room at the requested index in the `rooms` array.

 This version of `Residence` also provides a method called `printNumberOfRooms`, which simply prints the number of rooms in the residence.

 Finally, `Residence` defines an optional property called `address`, with a type of `Address?`. The `Address` class type for this property is defined below.

 The `Room` class used for the `rooms` array is a simple class with one property called name, and an initializer to set that property to a suitable room name:
*/
 class Room {
     let name: String
     init(name: String) { self.name = name }
 }
/*:
 The final class in this model is called `Address`. This class has three optional properties of type `String?`. The first two properties, `buildingName` and `buildingNumber`, are alternative ways to identify a particular building as part of an address. The third property, street, is used to name the `street` for that address:
*/
 class Address {
     var buildingName: String?
     var buildingNumber: String?
     var street: String?
     func buildingIdentifier() -> String? {
         if let buildingNumber = buildingNumber, let street = street {
             return "\(buildingNumber) \(street)"
         } else if buildingName != nil {
             return buildingName
         } else {
             return nil
         }
     }
 }
/*:
 The `Address` class also provides a method called `buildingIdentifier()`, which has a return type of `String?`. This method checks the properties of the address and returns `buildingName` if it has a value, or `buildingNumber` concatenated with `street` if both have values, or `nil` otherwise.
