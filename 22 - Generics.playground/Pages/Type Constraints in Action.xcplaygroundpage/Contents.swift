 ## Type Constraints in Action
 
 Here’s a nongeneric function called `findIndex(ofString:in:)`, which is given a `String` value to find and an array of `String` values within which to find it. The `findIndex(ofString:in:)` function returns an optional `Int` value, which will be the index of the first matching string in the array if it’s found, or `nil` if the string can’t be found:
*/
func findIndex(ofString valueToFind: String, in array: [String]) -> Int? {
    for (index, value) in array.enumerated() {
        if value == valueToFind {
            return index
        }
    }
    return nil
}
/*:
 The `findIndex(ofString:in:)` function can be used to find a string value in an array of strings:
*/
let strings = ["cat", "dog", "llama", "parakeet", "terrapin"]
if let foundIndex = findIndex(ofString: "llama", in: strings) {
    print("The index of llama is \(foundIndex)")
}
// Prints "The index of llama is 2"
/*:
 The principle of finding the index of a value in an array isn’t useful only for strings, however. You can write the same functionality as a generic function by replacing any mention of strings with values of some type T instead.

 Here’s how you might expect a generic version of `findIndex(ofString:in:)`, called `findIndex(of:in:)`, to be written. Note that the return type of this function is still `Int?`, because the function returns an optional index number, not an optional value from the array. Be warned, though — this function doesn’t compile, for reasons explained after the example:
*/
//func findIndex<T>(of valueToFind: T, in array:[T]) -> Int? {
//    for (index, value) in array.enumerated() {
//        if value == valueToFind {
//            return index
//        }
//    }
//    return nil
//}
/*:
 This function doesn’t compile as written above. The problem lies with the equality check, “`if value == valueToFind`”. Not every type in Swift can be compared with the equal to operator (`==`). If you create your own class or structure to represent a complex data model, for example, then the meaning of “equal to” for that class or structure isn’t something that Swift can guess for you. Because of this, it isn’t possible to guarantee that this code will work for every possible type `T`, and an appropriate error is reported when you try to compile the code.

 All is not lost, however. The Swift standard library defines a protocol called `Equatable`, which requires any conforming type to implement the equal to operator (`==`) and the not equal to operator (`!=`) to compare any two values of that type. All of Swift’s standard types automatically support the `Equatable` protocol.

 Any type that’s `Equatable` can be used safely with the `findIndex(of:in:)` function, because it’s guaranteed to support the equal to operator. To express this fact, you write a type constraint of `Equatable` as part of the type parameter’s definition when you define the function:
*/
func findIndex<T: Equatable>(of valueToFind: T, in array:[T]) -> Int? {
    for (index, value) in array.enumerated() {
        if value == valueToFind {
            return index
        }
    }
    return nil
}
/*:
 The single type parameter for `findIndex(of:in:)` is written as `T: Equatable`, which means “any type `T` that conforms to the `Equatable` protocol.”

 The `findIndex(of:in:)` function now compiles successfully and can be used with any type that’s `Equatable`, such as `Double` or `String`:
*/
let doubleIndex = findIndex(of: 9.3, in: [3.14159, 0.1, 0.25])
// doubleIndex is an optional Int with no value, because 9.3 isn't in the array
let stringIndex = findIndex(of: "Andrea", in: ["Mike", "Malcolm", "Andrea"])
// stringIndex is an optional Int containing a value of 2
