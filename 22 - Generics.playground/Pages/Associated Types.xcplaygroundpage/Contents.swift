 ## Associated Types
 
 When defining a protocol, it’s sometimes useful to declare one or more associated types as part of the protocol’s definition. An *associated type* gives a placeholder name to a type that’s used as part of the protocol. The actual type to use for that associated type isn’t specified until the protocol is adopted. Associated types are specified with the `associatedtype` keyword.
