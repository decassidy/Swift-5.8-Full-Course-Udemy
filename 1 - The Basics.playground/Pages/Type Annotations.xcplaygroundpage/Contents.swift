 ## Type Annotations
 
 You can provide a type annotation when you declare a constant or variable, to be clear about the kind of values the constant or variable can store. Write a type annotation by placing a colon after the constant or variable name, followed by a space, followed by the name of the type to use.

 This example provides a type annotation for a variable called `welcomeMessage`, to indicate that the variable can store `String` values:
*/
/*:
 - Callout(Example:):
 \
 `var welcomeMessage: String`
*/
var welcomeMessage: String
/*:
 The colon in the declaration means “…of type…,” so the code above can be read as:

 “Declare a variable called `welcomeMessage` that’s of type `String`.”

 The phrase “of type `String`” means “can store any `String` value.” Think of it as meaning “the type of thing” (or “the kind of thing”) that can be stored.

 The `welcomeMessage` variable can now be set to any string value without error:
 
 - Callout(Example:):\
 `welcomeMessage = "Hello"`
*/
welcomeMessage = "Hello"
/*:
 You can define multiple related variables of the same type on a single line, separated by commas, with a single type annotation after the final variable name:
 
 
 - Callout(Example:):
 `var red, green, blue: Double`
*/
var red, green, blue: Double
/*:
 - Note: It’s rare that you need to write type annotations in practice. If you provide an initial value for a constant or variable at the point that it’s defined, Swift can almost always infer the type to be used for that constant or variable, as described in [Type Safety and Type Inference](Type%20Safety%20and%20Type%20Inference). In the `welcomeMessage` example above, no initial value is provided, and so the type of the `welcomeMessage` variable is specified with a type annotation rather than being inferred from an initial value.
