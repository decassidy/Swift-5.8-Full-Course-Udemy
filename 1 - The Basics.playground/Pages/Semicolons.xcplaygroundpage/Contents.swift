  ## Semicolon
 
  Unlike many other languages, Swift doesnâ€™t require you to write a semicolon (`;`) after each statement in your code, although you can do so if you wish. However, semicolons are required if you want to write multiple separate statements on a single line:
 
  - Callout(Example:): `let cat = "ðŸ˜º"; print(cat)`
*/
let cat = "ðŸ˜º"; print(cat)
// Prints "ðŸ˜º"
