 # Constants and Variables
 
 Constants and variables associate a name (such as `maximumNumberOfLoginAttempts` or `welcomeMessage`) with a value of a particular type (such as the number `10` or the string `"Hello"`). The value of a constant can’t be changed once it’s set, whereas a variable can be set to a different value in the future.
