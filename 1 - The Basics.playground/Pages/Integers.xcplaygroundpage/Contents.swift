 ## Integers
 
 Integers are whole numbers with no fractional component, such as `42` and `-23`. Integers are either signed (positive, zero, or negative) or unsigned (positive or zero).

 Swift provides signed and unsigned integers in 8, 16, 32, and 64 bit forms. These integers follow a naming convention similar to C, in that an 8-bit unsigned integer is of type `UInt8`, and a 32-bit signed integer is of type `Int32`. Like all types in Swift, these integer types have capitalized names.
