 ## Accessing Superclass Methods, Properties, and Subscripts

 When you provide a method, property, or subscript override for a subclass, itâ€™s sometimes useful to use the existing superclass implementation as part of your override. For example, you can refine the behavior of that existing implementation, or store a modified value in an existing inherited variable.

 Where this is appropriate, you access the superclass version of a method, property, or subscript by using the `super` prefix:

 * An overridden method named `someMethod()` can call the superclass version of `someMethod()` by calling `super.someMethod()` within the overriding method implementation.

 * An overridden property called `someProperty` can access the superclass version of `someProperty` as `super.someProperty` within the overriding getter or setter implementation.

 * An overridden subscript for `someIndex` can access the superclass version of the same subscript as `super[someIndex]` from within the overriding subscript implementation.
