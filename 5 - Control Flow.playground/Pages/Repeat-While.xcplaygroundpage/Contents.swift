 ## Repeat-While

 The other variation of the `while` loop, known as the `repeat-while` loop, performs a single pass through the loop block first, *before* considering the loop’s condition. It then continues to repeat the loop until the condition is `false`.
*/
/*:
 - Note: The `repeat-while` loop in Swift is analogous to a `do-while` loop in other languages.
*/
//: Here’s the general form of a repeat-while loop:
/*:
  - Callout(Example:): \
  \
   `repeat {`\
   `    <#statement#>`\
 `} while <#condition#>`

/*:
 Here’s the *Snakes and Ladders* example again, written as a `repeat-while` loop rather than a `while` loop. The values of `finalSquare`, `board`, `square`, and `diceRoll` are initialized in exactly the same way as with a `while` loop.
*/
let finalSquare = 25
var board = [Int](repeating: 0, count: finalSquare + 1)
board[03] = +08; board[06] = +11; board[09] = +09; board[10] = +02
board[14] = -10; board[19] = -11; board[22] = -02; board[24] = -08
var square = 0
var diceRoll = 0
/*:
 In this version of the game, the *first* action in the loop is to check for a ladder or a snake. No ladder on the board takes the player straight to square `25`, and so it isn’t possible to win the game by moving up a ladder. Therefore, it’s safe to check for a snake or a ladder as the first action in the loop.

 At the start of the game, the player is on “square zero”. `board[0]` always equals `0` and has no effect.
*/
repeat {
    // move up or down for a snake or ladder
    square += board[square]
    // roll the dice
    diceRoll += 1
    if diceRoll == 7 { diceRoll = 1 }
    // move by the rolled amount
    square += diceRoll
} while square < finalSquare
print("Game over!")
/*:
 After the code checks for snakes and ladders, the dice is rolled and the player is moved forward by `diceRoll` squares. The current loop execution then ends.

 The loop’s condition `(while square < finalSquare)` is the same as before, but this time it’s not evaluated until the end of the first run through the loop. The structure of the `repeat-while` loop is better suited to this game than the while loop in the previous example. In the `repeat-while` loop above, `square += board[square]` is always executed immediately after the loop’s `while` condition confirms that square is still on the board. This behavior removes the need for the array bounds check seen in the while loop version of the game described earlier.
