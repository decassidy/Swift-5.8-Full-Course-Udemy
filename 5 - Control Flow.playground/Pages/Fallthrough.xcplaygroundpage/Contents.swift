 ## Fallthrough

 In Swift, `switch` statements don’t fall through the bottom of each case and into the next one. That is, the entire `switch` statement completes its execution as soon as the first matching case is completed. By contrast, C requires you to insert an explicit `break` statement at the end of every `switch` case to prevent fallthrough. Avoiding default fallthrough means that Swift `switch` statements are much more concise and predictable than their counterparts in C, and thus they avoid executing multiple `switch` cases by mistake.

 If you need C-style fallthrough behavior, you can opt in to this behavior on a case-by-case basis with the `fallthrough` keyword. The example below uses fallthrough to create a textual description of a number.

let integerToDescribe = 5
var description = "The number \(integerToDescribe) is"
switch integerToDescribe {
case 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19:
    description += " a prime number, and also"
    fallthrough
default:
    description += " an integer."
}
print(description)
// Prints "The number 5 is a prime number, and also an integer."
/*:
 This example declares a new `String` variable called `description` and assigns it an initial value. The function then considers the value of `integerToDescribe` using a switch statement. If the value of `integerToDescribe` is one of the prime numbers in the list, the function appends text to the end of `description`, to note that the number is prime. It then uses the `fallthrough` keyword to “fall into” the `default` case as well. The `default` case adds some extra text to the end of the description, and the `switch` statement is complete.

 Unless the value of `integerToDescribe` is in the list of known prime numbers, it isn’t matched by the first `switch` case at all. Because there are no other specific cases, `integerToDescribe` is matched by the `default` case.

 After the `switch` statement has finished executing, the number’s description is printed using the `print(_:separator:terminator:)` function. In this example, the number `5` is correctly identified as a prime number.

/*:
 - Note:The `fallthrough` keyword doesn’t check the case conditions for the `switch` case that it causes execution to fall into. The `fallthrough` keyword simply causes code execution to move directly to the statements inside the next case (or `default` case) block, as in C’s standard `switch` statement behavior.
