 ## Labeled Statements

 In Swift, you can nest loops and conditional statements inside other loops and conditional statements to create complex control flow structures. However, loops and conditional statements can both use the `break` statement to end their execution prematurely. Therefore, it’s sometimes useful to be explicit about which loop or conditional statement you want a `break` statement to terminate. Similarly, if you have multiple nested loops, it can be useful to be explicit about which loop the `continue` statement should affect.

 To achieve these aims, you can mark a loop statement or conditional statement with a statement label. With a conditional statement, you can use a statement label with the `break` statement to end the execution of the labeled statement. With a loop statement, you can use a statement label with the `break` or `continue` statement to end or continue the execution of the labeled statement.

 A labeled statement is indicated by placing a label on the same line as the statement’s introducer keyword, followed by a colon. Here’s an example of this syntax for a `while` loop, although the principle is the same for all loops and `switch` statements:
 
 ````
 <#label name#>: while <#condition#> {
    <#statements#>
 }
 ````
*/
/*:
 The following example uses the `break` and `continue` statements with a labeled `while` loop for an adapted version of the *Snakes and Ladders* game that you saw earlier in this chapter. This time around, the game has an extra rule:

 * To win, you must land *exactly* on square `25`.

 If a particular dice roll would take you beyond square `25`, you must roll again until you roll the exact number needed to land on square `25`.

 The game board is the same as before.

/*:
 The values of `finalSquare`, `board`, `square`, and `diceRoll` are initialized in the same way as before:
*/
let finalSquare = 25
var board = [Int](repeating: 0, count: finalSquare + 1)
board[03] = +08; board[06] = +11; board[09] = +09; board[10] = +02
board[14] = -10; board[19] = -11; board[22] = -02; board[24] = -08
var square = 0
var diceRoll = 0
/*:
 This version of the game uses a `while` loop and a `switch` statement to implement the game’s logic. The `while` loop has a statement label called `gameLoop` to indicate that it’s the main game loop for the Snakes and Ladders game.

 The `while` loop’s condition is `while square != finalSquare`, to reflect that you must land exactly on square `25`.
*/
gameLoop: while square != finalSquare {
    diceRoll += 1
    if diceRoll == 7 { diceRoll = 1 }
    switch square + diceRoll {
    case finalSquare:
        // diceRoll will move us to the final square, so the game is over
        break gameLoop
    case let newSquare where newSquare > finalSquare:
        // diceRoll will move us beyond the final square, so roll again
        continue gameLoop
    default:
        // this is a valid move, so find out its effect
        square += diceRoll
        square += board[square]
    }
}
print("Game over!")
/*:
 The dice is rolled at the start of each loop. Rather than moving the player immediately, the loop uses a switch statement to consider the result of the move and to determine whether the move is allowed:

 * If the dice roll will move the player onto the final square, the game is over. The `break gameLoop` statement transfers control to the first line of code outside of the `while` loop, which ends the game.

 * If the dice roll will move the player *beyond* the final square, the move is invalid and the player needs to roll again. The `continue gameLoop` statement ends the current `while` loop iteration and begins the next iteration of the loop.

 * In all other cases, the dice roll is a valid move. The player moves forward by `diceRoll` squares, and the game logic checks for any snakes and ladders. The loop then ends, and control returns to the `while` condition to decide whether another turn is required.
*/
/*:
 - Note:If the `break` statement above didn’t use the `gameLoop` label, it would break out of the `switch` statement, not the `while` statement. Using the `gameLoop` label makes it clear which control statement should be terminated.
    
     It isn’t strictly necessary to use the `gameLoop` label when calling `continue gameLoop` to jump to the next iteration of the loop. There’s only one loop in the game, and therefore no ambiguity as to which loop the `continue` statement will affect. However, there’s no harm in using the `gameLoop` label with the `continue` statement. Doing so is consistent with the label’s use alongside the `break` statement and helps make the game’s logic clearer to read and understand.
