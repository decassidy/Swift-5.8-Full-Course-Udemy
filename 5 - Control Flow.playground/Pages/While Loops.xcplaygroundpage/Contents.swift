 ## While Loops

 A `while` loop performs a set of statements until a condition becomes `false`. These kinds of loops are best used when the number of iterations isnâ€™t known before the first iteration begins. Swift provides two kinds of `while` loops:

 * `while` evaluates its condition at the start of each pass through the loop.

 * `repeat-while` evaluates its condition at the end of each pass through the loop.
