 ## Sets

 A *set* stores distinct values of the same type in a collection with no defined ordering. You can use a set instead of an array when the order of items isn’t important, or when you need to ensure that an item only appears once.
*/
/*:
 - Note: Swift’s `Set` type is bridged to Foundation’s `NSSet` class.

   For more information about using `Set` with Foundation and Cocoa, see [Bridging Between `Set` and `NSSet`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swift/set#2845530)\.
