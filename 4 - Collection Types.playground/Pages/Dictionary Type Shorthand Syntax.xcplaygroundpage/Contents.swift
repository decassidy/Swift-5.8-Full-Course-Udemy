 ## Dictionary Type Shorthand Syntax

 The type of a Swift dictionary is written in full as `Dictionary<Key, Value>`, where `Key` is the type of value that can be used as a dictionary key, and `Value` is the type of value that the dictionary stores for those keys.
*/
/*:
 - Note: A dictionary Key type must conform to the `Hashable` protocol, like a setâ€™s value type.
*/
/*:
 You can also write the type of a dictionary in shorthand form as `[Key: Value]`. Although the two forms are functionally identical, the shorthand form is preferred and is used throughout this course when referring to the type of a dictionary.
