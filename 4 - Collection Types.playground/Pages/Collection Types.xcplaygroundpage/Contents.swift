 # Collection Types
 ### Organize data using arrays, sets, and dictionaries.
 
 Swift provides three primary *collection types*, known as arrays, sets, and dictionaries, for storing collections of values. Arrays are ordered collections of values. Sets are unordered collections of unique values. Dictionaries are unordered collections of key-value associations.

/*:
 Arrays, sets, and dictionaries in Swift are always clear about the types of values and keys that they can store. This means that you can’t insert a value of the wrong type into a collection by mistake. It also means you can be confident about the type of values you will retrieve from a collection.
*/
/*:
 - Note: Swift’s array, set, and dictionary types are implemented as generic collections. For more about generic types and collections, see [Generics](https://docs.swift.org/swift-book/documentation/the-swift-programming-language/generics/)\.
