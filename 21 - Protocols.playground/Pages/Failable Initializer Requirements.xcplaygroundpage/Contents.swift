 ## Failable Initializer Requirements
 
 Protocols can define failable initializer requirements for conforming types, as defined in [Failable Initializers](https://docs.swift.org/swift-book/documentation/the-swift-programming-language/initialization/#Failable-Initializers)\.

 A failable initializer requirement can be satisfied by a failable or nonfailable initializer on a conforming type. A nonfailable initializer requirement can be satisfied by a nonfailable initializer or an implicitly unwrapped failable initializer.
