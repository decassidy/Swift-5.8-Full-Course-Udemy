 ## Initializer Requirements
 
 Protocols can require specific initializers to be implemented by conforming types. You write these initializers as part of the protocolâ€™s definition in exactly the same way as for normal initializers, but without curly braces or an initializer body:

 protocol SomeProtocol {
     init(someParameter: Int)
 }
