 ## Setting Initial Values for Stored Properties

 Classes and structures *must* set all of their stored properties to an appropriate initial value by the time an instance of that class or structure is created. Stored properties can’t be left in an indeterminate state.

 You can set an initial value for a stored property within an initializer, or by assigning a default property value as part of the property’s definition. These actions are described in the following sections.
*/
/*:
 - Note: When you assign a default value to a stored property, or set its initial value within an initializer, the value of that property is set directly, without calling any property observers.
