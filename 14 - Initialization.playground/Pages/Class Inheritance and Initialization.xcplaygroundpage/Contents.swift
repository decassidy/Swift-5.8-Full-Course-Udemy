 ## Class Inheritance and Initialization
 
 All of a class’s stored properties — including any properties the class inherits from its superclass — must be assigned an initial value during initialization.

 Swift defines two kinds of initializers for class types to help ensure all stored properties receive an initial value. These are known as designated initializers and convenience initializers.
