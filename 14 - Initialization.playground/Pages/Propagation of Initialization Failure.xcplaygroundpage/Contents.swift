 ## Propagation of Initialization Failure
 
 A failable initializer of a class, structure, or enumeration can delegate across to another failable initializer from the same class, structure, or enumeration. Similarly, a subclass failable initializer can delegate up to a superclass failable initializer.

 In either case, if you delegate to another initializer that causes initialization to fail, the entire initialization process fails immediately, and no further initialization code is executed.
*/
/*:
 - Note:A failable initializer can also delegate to a nonfailable initializer. Use this approach if you need to add a potential failure state to an existing initialization process that doesnâ€™t otherwise fail.

/*:
 The example below defines a subclass of `Product` called `CartItem`. The `CartItem` class models an item in an online shopping cart. `CartItem` introduces a stored constant property called `quantity` and ensures that this property always has a value of at least `1`:
*/
class Product {
    let name: String
    init?(name: String) {
        if name.isEmpty { return nil }
        self.name = name
    }
}

class CartItem: Product {
    let quantity: Int
    init?(name: String, quantity: Int) {
        if quantity < 1 { return nil }
        self.quantity = quantity
        super.init(name: name)
    }
}
/*:
 The failable initializer for `CartItem` starts by validating that it has received a `quantity` value of `1` or more. If the `quantity` is invalid, the entire initialization process fails immediately and no further initialization code is executed. Likewise, the failable initializer for `Product` checks the name value, and the initializer process fails immediately if name is the empty string.

 If you create a `CartItem` instance with a nonempty name and a quantity of `1` or more, initialization succeeds:
*/
if let twoSocks = CartItem(name: "sock", quantity: 2) {
    print("Item: \(twoSocks.name), quantity: \(twoSocks.quantity)")
}
// Prints "Item: sock, quantity: 2"
/*:
 If you try to create a `CartItem` instance with a `quantity` value of `0`, the `CartItem` initializer causes initialization to fail:
*/
if let zeroShirts = CartItem(name: "shirt", quantity: 0) {
    print("Item: \(zeroShirts.name), quantity: \(zeroShirts.quantity)")
} else {
    print("Unable to initialize zero shirts")
}
// Prints "Unable to initialize zero shirts"
/*:
 Similarly, if you try to create a `CartItem` instance with an empty name value, the superclass `Product` initializer causes initialization to fail:
*/
if let oneUnnamed = CartItem(name: "", quantity: 1) {
    print("Item: \(oneUnnamed.name), quantity: \(oneUnnamed.quantity)")
} else {
    print("Unable to initialize one unnamed product")
}
// Prints "Unable to initialize one unnamed product"
